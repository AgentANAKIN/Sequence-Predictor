# Sequence-Predictor
<p>This code tries to determine the next number in a sequence (for non-mathematicians).</p>
<p>It currently recognizes in both ascending and descending orders:</p>
<ol>
<li>arithmetic sequences</li>
<li>cube numbers</li>
<li>fibonacci sequences</li>
<li>geometric sequences</li>
<li>linear sequences</li>
<li>prime numbers</li>
<li>quadratic sequences</li>
<li>square numbers</li>
<li>tetrahedral sequences</li>
<li>triangular numbers</li>
</ol>
<p>I will be adding more rules, but my ultimate goal is to get the code to recognize rules that I do not so that it can predict numbers that I cannot.
